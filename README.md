# Background and importance of the problem
Nowadays, more and more people are interested in investing. Because there is any investment Investors often want a return on that investment in the form of profits. In order to get more assets from investment We can see from the rich people who are ranked at the top of the world rankings. From investment
An investment that investors believe will yield the fastest returns is the stock market. Because investing in the stock market brings returns that satisfy investors. Some stocks are big companies with strong ventures. In other words, it is unlikely that the company will go bankrupt.
In the past, most investors had speculated on the stock market with technical analysis. That kind of technical analysis poses a risk to the start of an investment. Because of the lack of investment experience It can cause the loss of assets in the investment to the point of bankruptcy as well.
Subsequently, the data analysis was carried out with a neural network. It is an important tool that has been applied in the stock market. The stock market data that has been collected will be analyzed to provide more direction for investors. In order to make these investors receive returns that are satisfied.

# objectives
1. To study the utilization of artificial intelligence to its application in the stock market.
2. To facilitate investors in helping them make investment decisions of artificial intelligence.
3. To give this thesis a guide to investing in the stock market.

# Scope of the project
1.Design a model that uses the power of artificial intelligence to help make stock trading decisions.
2.Increase the functionality of the model by incorporating the neural network system into the model.
3. Compare the model's stock trading returns with benchmarks and relevant measurement theories as well as website impressions.

# Conclusion
The adoption of artificial intelligence as a tool to aid investment for investors has become a popular investment method in modern times. Apply data science knowledge to analyze and allow models to manage themselves how they should be invested. Where investors do not have to monitor their performance all the time This thesis presents the invention of artificial intelligence by using the fundamentals of investment as the basis for making investment decisions. Because the management of investment portfolios is risky because the factors of stock price information on a daily basis are constantly fluctuating and cannot predict the industry trend of that stock. Under this idea, this artificial intelligence model that buys and sells stocks each time has to receive a satisfactory return on investment, with the performance of that model compared to the return. Of that stock market The return on investment that the model receives from its performance is better. Therefore, it fits the basic concept of the model that wants to work at its most cost-effective. In order to receive a satisfactory return to investors
